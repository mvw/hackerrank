# Project Euler #5 Smallest multiple

## Problem
http://www.hackerrank.com/contests/projecteuler/challenges/euler005

## Solution

This is obviously the least common multiple (LCM) of the numbers from
1 to N. 

As the ranges for T and N values are quite low, we can hack this down 
without need for optimization.
