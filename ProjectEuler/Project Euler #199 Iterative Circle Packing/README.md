# Project Euler #199 Iterative Circle Packing

## Problem
http://www.hackerrank.com/contests/projecteuler/challenges/euler199

Calculate the area of an interesting recursive geometric construction.


## Solution
To be published at a later time.

I am not sure yet, what time lag is appropriate for this active contest. 

## My first Erlang GUI application
Of course this problem caused an itch to draw it. :smiley_cat:

As usual with geometric problems I fiddle with the incredible [GeoGebra](https://www.geogebra.org)
software to get an idea what is going on. 

Alas programming something more complex in GeoGebra is not very comfortable
right now, one has to bring in JavaScript code by some means I can hardly
remember.

So I took a look at Erlang's GUI capabilities.
It turned out that it still features bindings for [wxWidgets](http://www.wxwidgets.org/).

I booted via Michael Turner 's tutorial at http://www.idiom.com/~turner/wxtut/wxwidgets.html
and looking at some of the examples that come with Erlang.

And the result is [gui.erl](https://github.com/mvw/hackerrank/blob/master/ProjectEuler/Project%20Euler%20%23199%20Iterative%20Circle%20Packing/gui.erl)

It is not very comfortable yet, the two parameters `m` and `n`are hard coded right now, but it
does its job. :smirk_cat:

Here is an overview with some screen shots:

I might extend it and clean it at some later time.


## Experience
Very nice task.
