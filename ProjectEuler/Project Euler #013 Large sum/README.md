# Project Euler #13 Large sum

## Problem

http://www.hackerrank.com/contests/projecteuler/challenges/euler013

For 1 <= N <= 10^3 we get a list X_1, .., X_N with 
of 50 digit integer numbers.

We have to output the first ten digits of their sum.

## Solution

Straight forward use of Erlang integer computation. 
And I/O is fast enough for the test cases. 

## Experience

Enjoyed the quickie.
