This hackerrank domain is limited to the use of a couple of functional programming languages, 
some challenges even use lamdba calculus expressions. :smile:

So chances are good that the problems can be tackled within the 
[run-time constraints](http://www.hackerrank.com/environment) for Erlang, which is not always
the case for the other hackerrank domains.
