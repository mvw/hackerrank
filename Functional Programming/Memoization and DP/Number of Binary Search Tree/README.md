# Number of Binary Search Tree

## Problem
http://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/number-of-binary-search-tree

The basic task here is to calculate the number of binary search trees (BST) for a set of nodes 1..N

## Experience

I solved this after the topic related Valid BST problem (see below).

It turned out that my optimization to only calculate about half of the products was not
needed to tackle the test cases.
I added the de-optimized version, which is shorter, as ``solution2.erl``.
