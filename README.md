# hackerrank
This repository contains some of my submissions to [hackerrank](http://www.hackerrank.com).

I enjoy banging my head against the challenges using [Erlang](http://www.erlang.org).
If this seems not possible I tell them to my friend [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org).

## So long, and thanks for all the fish

I moved this project to [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/mvanwoerkom/hackerrank).

Kudos to GitHub for their ground-breaking work.
